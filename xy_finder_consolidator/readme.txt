This tool is for finding the x and y coordiantes within .points files and exporting just those points to a csv format, openable with excel 
or other spreadsheeting software. 

To use, copy this directory to your local machine and change directory in terminal to this one. 
Copy the points files you wish for it to scan through into the folder. 
In terminal run:
  ./consolidator.sh 
  
This will run and create a new csv file with the contents of the x and y axis.
